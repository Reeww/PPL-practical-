Question 1||Automobile database

Model the following Automobile information system as a graph model, and answer the following queries using Cypher.
Consider an Automobile industry manufacturing different types of vehicles like Heavy Vehicles, Light Vehicles, etc. A customer can buy one or more types of vehicle. A person can recommend or rate a vehicle type.
1.	Identify the labels and relationships, along with their properties, and draw Graph model. 
2.	Create nodes and relationships, along with their properties, and visualize your actual Graph model.
3.	Answer the Queries
	a.	List the characteristics of heavy vehicle types. 
	b.	List the name of customers who bought a light vehicle. 
	c.	List the customers who bought more than one type of vehicle. 
	d.	List the most recommended vehicle type.



CREATE(heavy:vehicle {type:'Heavy Vehicle',characteristics:['weighted vehicle','more than four tyres','high cc']})
CREATE(light:vehicle {type:'Light Vehicle',characteristics:['light weight vehicle','four tyres vehicle','low cc']})

Solution for the queries

a.List the characteristics of heavy vehicle types.
match(v1:vehicle{type:"Heavy Vehicle"})
return v1.characteristics


b.List the name of customers who bought a light vehicle. 
match(c1:Customer)-[:Bought]->(v1:vehicle{type:"Light Vehicle" })
return c1.Name

c.List the customers who bought more than one type of vehicle.
match(c1:Customer)-[:Bought]->(v1:vehicle{type:"Light Vehicle" }),(c2:Customer)-[:Bought]->(v2:vehicle{type:"Heavy Vehicle" })
where c1.Name=c2.Name 
return c1.Name


d.List the most recommended vehicle type.
match(c1:Customer)-[:Recommends]->(v1:vehicle) return v1.type,count(*)

Question 2||University database

Model the following University information system as a graph model, and answer the following queries using Cypher.
University has various departments like Mathematics, Geology, Chemistry, etc. Each department conducts various courses and a course may be conducted by multiple departments. Every course may have recommendations provided by people.
1.	Identify the labels and relationships, along with their properties, and draw Graph model.
2.	Create nodes and relationships, along with their properties, and visualize your actual Graph model.
3.	Answer the Queries
	a.	List the names of the courses provided by Chemistry Department. 
	b.	List the details of all the departments in the university.
	c.	List the names of common courses across chemistry and zoology department. 
	d.	List the most recommended course in Computer Science Department.
